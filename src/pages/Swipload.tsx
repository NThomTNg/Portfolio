                      I had my internship during the fall of 2024 at Swipload Technologies AS, a startup company that works in 
                      software development to streamline processes within logistics and transportation by eliminating manual interactions 
                      with carriers through tools like Excel. The main functions include freight order management, 
                      real-time freight status updates, delivery confirmation solutions, and data analysis reports.

                      I started the internship with little expectations of what I would do and learn. After my time at the company,
                      I have learned an incredible amount about what it is like to work in a professional environment with other developers. I have gained a deeper understanding
                      of what it is like to work with a professional team, and gained a deeper appreciation for development work, especially when it comes to
                      structure, code quality, and testing. During the project, we mainly worked with Svelte as a front-end framework, which was new to me.
                      I have previously worked with React, so it was an interesting experience to work with a different framework.
                      I also gained valuable experience with Azure DevOps, Docker, API integration, and Azure Databases.
                      My internship experience at Swipload has been very positive, and I have learned a lot about what it is like to
                      be part of a professional development team.
